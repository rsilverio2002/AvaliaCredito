[Training] Credit Risk evaluation project to practice machine learning process. Created during the 'Big Data Analytics and Machine Learning with R and Azure Machine Learning' course from Data Science Academy.

It comprises a simple classification problem process using the following steps:
- Analyse features in order to identify if there are candidates to participate on the feature list
- Bin numeric variables in order to make the algorithms' job easier
- Identify the key features using the 'rfe' function from the CARET package.
- SMOTE data in order to make the dataset more balanced
- Create Training and Testing datasets
- Train 3 different Models: Naive_Bayes, SVMLinear, Adaboost
- Create diagnostics and ROC Curves for each of them.
